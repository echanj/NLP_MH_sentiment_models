Description:

NLP has emerged as a significant area of research in mental health classification. A narrative review of 399 studies from 10,467 records revealed an upward trend in research focused on mental illness detection using NLP. Deep learning methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches. Topic models have been used to understand differences in language usage between individuals with depression and those without. Data cleansing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, handling null entries, punctuation removal, and lemmatization are commonly employed.

EDA techniques such as bar plots, word clouds, and cosine similarity matrices were used to gain insights into the data. Feature engineering techniques such as count vectorization, TF-IDF vectorization, GloVe embeddings, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were employed. Character-level TF-IDF vectors have advantages over word-level representations, and binary classifier models such as Nave Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and SGD-Huber were applied to the data. NLP techniques have shown great potential in empowering mental healthcare diagnosis and aiding in the early detection of mental illnesses.
